## Project Details
With Interscool, we aim to fill the gap in the adaptability and English language issues that are faced by the ELICOS students who come to Australia by providing them a platform to self-examine, learn and improve their English skills and the knowledge of the Australian culture, all under one roof. Being non-native English speakers ourselves, we aim to use our own experience to help ELICOS students integrate themselves into life in Australia. Our mission is to create a memorable user experience that can be fun as well as informative to improve their literacy of the global language, with a local flavor.
