## Project Details
English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) are central to Australiaâ€™s international education sector. Students come from overseas to study the English language for a variety of reasons. Some need to improve their English for work or career purposes, some have a personal interest in becoming fluent in English, and some intend to travel. Others may want to continue their education in English, either in Australia or elsewhere, and need to develop the necessary language skills to undertake further study.
We would like to provide assisstance in learning Enlgish and better adapting life in Australia for ELICOS students.
